Absolutely cool analogy across beatboxing and testing, presented in the most engaging way I‚Äôve ever seen a topic presented. At the first round of beatboxing it was like ‚Äúok cool impressive but talk to us about testing‚Äù but after the analogy of an un-amplified ‚Äúfart noise‚Äù and the same thing being a cool sound into a mic delivered the message and from then on it was a ‚Äúmind blown‚Äù state.

The idea seemed novel, but it needs definitely a lot more experimentation until he gets it right, definitely using his beats less and less until they become an great enhancement not integral part of his shall I say performance. To this point I feel like I saw a guy with a funny coloured pair of shoes farting from his mouth, who somehow convinced the organisers that he would talk about QA.","2018-05-11T09:57:34.130Z"
