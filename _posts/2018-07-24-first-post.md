Throughout May and June UXDX ran mini community events in 8 different cities across Europe. The core concept was the same; break down the siloes with product development teams by bringing together different speakers, from UXers, designers, product managers and developers, to give insights on their focus within the product life-cycle. The beauty of this was the ability to identify the themes and trends being repeated in the more than 40 different companies that presented. Our team were overwhelmed with the insights that we got from the cities, and this series of blogs will go through these trends.

## Agile Planning
One of the misconceptions about agile is that you donâ€™t need to plan - you can react and change as you go. However, product planning is just as important in an agile context as in traditional waterfall environments.

In the previous article on Agile Transformation, we discussed the benefit of having a goal and principles for your product. 
A visible and inspiring goal helps to motivate the team to work hard to reach the goal by instilling a sense of purpose into their work. However the purpose of a goal is the outcome you are trying to achieve. While a goal meets its need of inspiring the team it is too high level to provide the necessary direction for a team as they move into implementation.
